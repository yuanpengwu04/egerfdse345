So far the project has included: an ugly ui of login, signup and home page which has no functionalities yet and whose appearance will definitely be altered vastly in the coming months; auth api that support login, signup and logout without passportjs; user api that gets users for the sidebar; message api that get and send messages. The data storage part is supported by MongoDB and nothing else.

As you will see from the code, the initial version of the app will get ALL users from the database and display ALL of them on the sidebar, and it will only support one-to-one messaging. I plan to develop them from this version so they can form groups which have admins. The data models are expected to be changed as well.
